## Loading and preprocessing the data
I used read.csv to load the data from my working directory. I loaded ggplot2, dplyr, zoo and knitr.

## Tidying data
To tidy the data, I converted the dates column from a character to Dates using the as.Date function.
I also created a new data frame that used na.omit to get rid of NA values.

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
mean = 9354.23
median answer = 10395

## What is the average daily activity pattern?
The 5-minute interval that, on average, contains the maximum number of steps is interval 835 (8:35am)

## Imputing missing values
I used the na.aggregate from the Zoo library to impute missing step values.

## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
While activity starts later in the day on the weekends, it is higher throughout the day than on weekdays.
